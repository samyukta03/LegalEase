"The case involves an appeal by special leave against an order of the High Court at Patna, which affirmed the conviction of the appellant by the Additional Sessions Judge, Arrah, under Section 147 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The appellant, along with 13 others, was charged with being a member of an unlawful assembly with the common object of dispossessing one Chulhan Tewari (the complainant) and assaulting and murdering one Nasiba Ahir and others. The prosecution alleged that the appellant led a group armed with a gun and lathis to dispossess the complainant of a piece of land. The appellant fired three shots from the gun, injuring several individuals, including Nasiba Ahir who later died in the hospital. The Additional Sessions Judge found that the apparent title to the land was in dispute and that neither party could claim the right of private defense to property. The judge also found that while the appellant's party used a gun, the complainant's party used lathis or brickbats, resulting in injuries on both sides. The judge convicted the appellant under Section 304, Part II, read with Section 149, and sentenced him to five years of rigorous imprisonment. The judge also found the appellant guilty of rioting under Section 147 but did not impose a separate sentence for that offense. The other 13 individuals charged were acquitted due to lack of proper identification. The appellant's petition for special leave to appeal was admitted by the Supreme Court, which considered three grounds: (1) whether there was an unlawful assembly, (2) whether the possession of the complainant was established, and (3) whether any member of the appellant's party was armed with a gun. The Supreme Court found that there was sufficient evidence to establish the existence of an unlawful assembly. However, it remanded the case to the High Court for rehearing because the High Court did not apply itself seriously to the question of possession, which was crucial to the case. The Supreme Court held that a clear finding on possession was necessary to determine the aggressor in the incident. In conclusion, the Supreme Court set aside the conviction and sentence of the appellant and remanded the case to the High Court for rehearing and disposal according to law, with a direction to record a definite finding on the question of possession.","The High Court affirmed the conviction of the appellant.

"This case involves an appeal under Article 132(1) of the Constitution against a judgment and order of the Bombay High Court dated 1st September 1950, in Criminal Application No. 807 of 1950. The respondent was detained under the Preventive Detention Act (IV of 1950) on grounds of promoting acts of sabotage on railway and railway property in Greater Bombay. The respondent filed a habeas corpus petition contending that the government's aim was to lock up active trade unionists and that the grounds for detention were vague and did not mention specifics of the alleged sabotage. The High Court ordered the respondent's release, finding the grounds for detention to be insufficient. The appellant, the Attorney-General, appealed this decision. The Supreme Court, in its judgment delivered by Kania C.J., held that preventive detention orders must be based on the satisfaction of the Central or State Government and that the grounds, while not required to be exhaustive, must be connected in some manner with the objects to be prevented. The Court stated that it was not for the court to substitute its decision for that of the government, as long as the grounds were such that a rational human being could consider them connected to the objects to be prevented.","The Supreme Court allowed the appeal and reversed the decision of the Bombay High Court, upholding the detention of the respondent under the Preventive Detention Act.",0,,"Key info:  This case involves an appeal under Article 132(1) of the Constitution against a judgment and order of the Bombay High Court dated 1st September 1950, in Criminal Application No. 807 of 1950.

"This case involves an appeal by the State of West Bengal against a judgment of a Full Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Calcutta, which quashed the conviction of the respondent by the Special Court established under the West Bengal Special Courts Ordinance, 1949. The respondent and 49 others were charged with various offences allegedly committed during a raid on a factory known as the Jessop Factory at Dum Dum. They were convicted and sentenced by the Special Court, but the respondent challenged the jurisdiction of the Special Court, arguing that the enabling provision under which the case was sent for trial was unconstitutional and violated the equal protection of laws guaranteed by Article 14 of the Constitution. The High Court, in a Full Bench decision, quashed the conviction and directed a new trial. The State of West Bengal appealed this decision. The Supreme Court noted that the West Bengal Special Courts Act, 1950, was enacted to provide for speedier trial of certain offences, and section 5 of the Act empowered the State Government to constitute Special Courts. The respondent relied on the US Supreme Court decisions in Truax v. Corrigan and Yick Wo v. Hopkins to argue that the Act violated equal protection under the law. However, the Supreme Court held that the Act did not violate Article 14, as it was applicable to a class of persons and was not administered in a discriminatory manner. The Court emphasized that the legislation aimed at preventing heinous crimes must be interpreted in a manner that the common man can understand and appreciate, to ensure faith and confidence in the legal system. The Court concluded that the Act did not violate the Constitution and dismissed the appeal, upholding the validity of the West Bengal Special Courts Act, 1950.","The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal and upheld the validity of the West Bengal Special Courts Act, 1950, finding that it did not violate the equal protection of laws guaranteed by Article 14 of the Constitution.",1,,"Key info:  This case involves an appeal by the State of West Bengal against a judgment of a Full Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Calcutta, which quashed the conviction of the respondent by the Special Court established under the West Bengal Special Courts Ordinance, 1949.

" This	 is  the  ordinary  accepted
meaning	 of  the  word "" decree "" and  if  that	 meaning  is
attributed to the word "" decree "" occurring in section 18(1)
then clearly it cannot cover an order for possession  passed
under section 43 of the Presidency Small Cause Courts Act on
an application made under section 41 of that Act.
It is, however, urged that the word "" decree"" in -section 18
(1)  of	 Act XVII of 1950 should not be read in	 its  strict
sense.	It is said that although the word ""suit""  ordinarily
means  a proceeding instituted by a plaint, it is also	used
in  a wider sense so as to cover proceedings which  are	 not
instituted  by a plaint and, therefore., an adjudication  in
those  proceedings  which are also suits  in  that  extended
meaning	 may well be said to be a "" decree"".   Reference  is
made to the explanation of sub-section (1) of section 12  of
Act  XVII  of  1950, which expressly provides  that  in	 the
proviso to sub-section (1) the term ""suit"" does not  include
proceeding  under Chapter VII of the Presidency Small  Cause
Courts	Act,  1882, and it is urged  that  this	 explanation
inferentially means that the word "" suit "" occurring in	 the
other sections of Act XVII of 1950 may include a  proceeding
under  Chapter VII of the Presidency Small Cause Courts	 Act
and,  therefore, an order made on such a proceeding  may  be
described  as  an adjudication in a suit and,  therefore,  a
decree.	  It is not quite clear how this inference, even  if
it  can	 be  properly drawn, can have  any  bearing  on	 the
construction  of  the word ""decree"" in	sub-section  (1)  of
section	 18 of the Act XVII of 1960 where the word "" suit  ""

has  made a mistake.  The Court must proceed on the  footing
that  the  Legislature intended what it has said.   Even  if
there  is  some	 defect	 in  the  phraseology  used  by	 the
Legislature the Court cannot, as pointed out in Crawford  v.
Spooner(1),  aid the Legislature's defective phrasing of  an
Act or add and amend or, by   construction,	make	  up
deficiencies which are left in	   the	 Act.	Even   where
there is a casus omissus, it is, as	said by Lord Russell
of Killowen in Hansraj Gupta v.	   Official  Liquidator	  of
Dehra  Dun-Mussoorie  Electric Tramway Co.,  Ltd.  (2),	 for
others than the Courts to remedy the defect.  In our view it
is  not right to give to the word "" decree"" a meaning  other
than its ordinary accepted meaning and we are bound to	say,
in  spite  of our profound respect for the opinions  of	 the
learned	 Judges	 who decided them, that	 the  several  cases
relied on by the respondent were not correctly decided.
Reference was made, in, course of argument, to section 6  of
the  West Bengal Act LXII of 1950.  That section  refers  to
orders or decrees made between the commencement of Act	XVII
of 1950 and Act LXII of 1950, i.e., between the 30th  March,
1950,  and  the	 30th November, 1950, and  cannot  have	 any
application to the order for possession made in this case on
the 27th February, 1950.

For reasons stated above this appeal must be allowed and the
order  made  by the High Court should be set aside  and	 the
respondents' application under section 18 (1) of Act XVII of
1950  should be dismissed and we order accordingly.  In	 the
circumstances  of  this case we make no order  as  to  costs
except	that  the  parties  should  bear  their	 own   costs
throughout.

"These appeals stem from an order of discharge issued by the Subordinate Judge-Magistrate of Dhanbad under section 494 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, allowing the withdrawal of the Public Prosecutor from a prosecution against Mahesh Desai, one of the accused in a murder case. The prosecution alleged that Desai abetted the murder of Nand Kumar Chaubey during a riot. The Public Prosecutor sought withdrawal of the case against Desai, citing lack of evidence to establish a prima facie case. The Magistrate granted the withdrawal, which was upheld by the Sessions Judge on revision. However, the Chief Justice of the High Court set aside the withdrawal, directing the Magistrate to record evidence and determine if a prima facie case existed against Desai. The State challenged this decision, arguing that the Chief Justice's view was based on an erroneous understanding of the law.","The Supreme Court upheld the decision of the Chief Justice of the High Court, ruling that the withdrawal of the case against Desai was not justified and that evidence should be recorded to determine if a prima facie case existed against him.",1,,"Key info:  These appeals stem from an order of discharge issued by the Subordinate Judge-Magistrate of Dhanbad under section 494 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, allowing the withdrawal of the Public Prosecutor from a prosecution against Mahesh Desai, one of the accused in a murder case.

"The appellants, Maitland Craig Lubricants Ltd. and H. J. Leach, filed a suit in the Bombay High Court for damages for conversion against the respondents.

"The case involved a writ petition filed by the Hospital Mazdoor Sabha, a trade union registered under the Industrial Trade Unions Act XIV of 1926, and two of its members, Mrs. Vatsala Narayan and Mrs. Ruth Isaac, against the State of Bombay. The respondents, Mrs. Narayan and Mrs. Isaac, were employed as Ward servants in the J. J. group of Hospitals. Their services were terminated, and two State servants who were discharged from the Civil Supplies Department were appointed in their place.

The respondents challenged the termination of their services, alleging that it was void as it did not comply with the mandatory provisions of Sections 25F and 25H of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (the Act). They filed a writ petition seeking a writ of mandamus directing the appellant to reinstate them in their posts.

The appellant, the State of Bombay, contested the petition on several grounds. It argued that the termination orders were not void and that the writ application was misconceived because the J. J. group of Hospitals did not constitute an industry, making the relevant provisions of the Act inapplicable.

The petition was first heard by Tendolkar J., who dismissed it, holding that even if the relevant provisions of the Act were applicable, the termination orders were not void. He also held that the question about the application of Section 25H did not arise.

The matter was then taken to the Court of Appeal, which held that the termination orders had not complied with the mandatory provisions of Section 25F and were therefore invalid. The Court of Appeal also held that the J. J. group of Hospitals constituted an industry within the meaning of the Act.

The State, conceding the remissions, contended he could only be considered for release after completing 15 years of actual imprisonment. The Court noted that before 1955, a sentence of transportation for life could be served as rigorous imprisonment for life in India. However, post-1955, such a convict would be treated as undergoing rigorous imprisonment for the same term. The remissions earned would be credited towards the term, but unless the sentence was commuted or remitted, the convict was bound to serve life imprisonment.

"This case involves an assessee's appeal against the High Court of Patna's judgment dismissing its writ petition under Arts 226 and 227 of the Indian Constitution. The assessee, a partnership firm, had construction contracts under the Railways and the Government. For the assessment year 1960-61, it was asked by the Income-tax Officer to produce its books of account and other relevant papers. After an enquiry, the assessee's total income was assessed. Subsequently, the Income-tax Officer issued a notice under s. 148 of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1961, to re-assess the income for the said assessment year. The assessee challenged the validity of the notice on various grounds, including non-compliance with the requirements of s. 151(2) of the Act. The Supreme Court found that the notice was invalid as it did not comply with the requirements of s. 151(2) of the Act, which states that no notice shall be issued under Section 148 after the expiry of four years from the end of the relevant assessment year unless the Commissioner is satisfied on the reasons recorded by the Income-tax Officer that it is a fit case for the issue of such notice. The Court held that the Income-tax Officer did not have reasons to believe that the income had escaped assessment, as required by s. 147 of the Act. The Court set aside the High Court's order and quashed the impugned notice.

"The appeal arose from a decision of the Calcutta High Court on a question of law regarding the interpretation of section 271(1)(a)(i) of the Income Tax Act. The Tribunal sought the High Court's opinion on whether the penalty should be determined based on the tax assessed under section 143 of the Act or the amount payable under section 156. The Revenue argued that the penalty should be based on the tax assessed, while the assessee and interveners contended that it should be based on the amount payable under section 156.

"The case involved lifers (prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment) seeking consideration for premature release under the Punjab Jail Manual.

"The statement discusses a case where the prosecutrix has testified to being raped, and the court is analyzing the evidence presented. The court finds the prosecutrix to be a reliable witness with no discrepancies in her testimony.

The court dismisses the trial court's conclusion that the prosecutrix was habituated to sexual intercourse based on medical evidence and finds it irresponsible.

The respondent had filed multiple bail applications, all of which were either rejected by the High Court or overturned by the Supreme Court in earlier appeals. Despite this, the respondent filed a ninth bail application, which was granted by the High Court on the grounds of prolonged incarceration and delay in trial proceedings.

The appellants argued that the High Court ignored previous findings of the Supreme Court and failed to consider the seriousness of the charges and the respondent's behavior during previous periods of bail. They contended that the grant of bail was unwarranted.

The respondent's counsel argued that the right to liberty is fundamental, and successive bail applications are permissible. They asserted that the High Court properly considered the evidence and concluded that there was no prima facie case against the respondent.

The Supreme Court examined whether previous bail applications had addressed the existence of a prima facie case against the respondent and the evidentiary value of a retracted confession.

"The case revolves around the death of Bhimabai, who was allegedly subjected to harassment by her husband and mother-in-law (the accused) for dowry. Bhimabai's father testified that she had complained about ill-treatment and demands for money from her parental home. On the day of her death, Bhimabai was found dead with froth coming out of her mouth, indicating poisoning. The post-mortem examination confirmed insecticide poisoning as the cause of death.

The prosecution charged the accused under Sections 498-A, 304-B, and 306 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

The trial court had found the respondent guilty of financing and trading in heroin. Despite the conviction, the High Court granted bail to the respondent.

The Union of India argued that the High Court erred in granting bail without considering the mandatory provisions of Section 37 of the NDPS Act. The section imposes restrictions and conditions for granting bail in cases under the NDPS Act.

The respondent contended that the High Court's order should not be interfered with, as it was discretionary and within the Court's jurisdiction.

The Supreme Court observed that the High Court had overlooked the requirements of Section 37 of the NDPS Act while granting bail. Section 37 lays down specific conditions for granting bail in NDPS cases, including giving an opportunity to the Public Prosecutor to oppose the release and ensuring that there are reasonable grounds to believe the accused is not guilty and will not commit any offense while on bail.

"In this case, the main issue revolves around the interpretation of Section 147 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, specifically concerning the concept of ""change of opinion."" The question at hand is whether the concept of ""change of opinion"" remains relevant after the amendment of Section 147 by the Direct Tax Laws (Amendment) Act, 1987.

Prior to the 1987 amendment, Section 147 allowed for reassessment based on specific conditions. However, post-amendment, only one condition remained, which was if the Assessing Officer had reason to believe that income had escaped assessment. This change widened the power of the Assessing Officer to reopen assessments.

The court emphasized the importance of interpreting the term ""reason to believe"" in a manner that prevents arbitrary use of power by the Assessing Officer. It stated that the concept of ""change of opinion"" acts as a check against abuse of power and should be treated as an inherent test.

The court also highlighted the distinction between the power to review and the power to reassess, noting that the Assessing Officer does not have the authority to review assessments but can only reassess them based on certain preconditions.

The judgment further discussed the legislative history and the reasons behind the reintroduction of the expression ""reason to believe"" and the removal of the term ""opinion"" in Section 147.

"This case involves a suit by a Muslim co-sharer seeking recovery of her share of her father's property from her siblings.

The main points of contention were whether the plaintiff was entitled to mesne profits from the immovable property and whether she was entitled to interest on her share of the assets from her father's partnership. The court dismissed arguments regarding mesne profits due to lack of discussion and issue in the lower court. Regarding interest, the court found that the Interest Act did not apply as the amount in dispute was not a debt or a certain sum payable at a certain time.

"This case involves an appeal arising from a suit to set aside an order passed against the plaintiff who attached properties in execution of a decree obtained against the 2nd defendant.

The District Munsif initially ruled in favor of the temple, but the Subordinate Judge reversed the decision, stating that Ex. I required registration for the title to pass to the temple. However, the appellant argues that Ex. I does not require registration as it constitutes a religious trust and does not transfer property directly. The court analyzes Ex. I and concludes that it does not require registration under the Trusts Act or the Transfer of Property Act. Additionally, the court emphasizes that dedication to a deity does not necessarily require a registered instrument.

"This case involves two connected appeals. One appeal is from an order dismissing the appellant's application to restore a petition to set aside a sale, which had been dismissed for default. The other appeal is from the order dismissing the petition to set aside the sale itself. The appellant, who was adjudicated insolvent, made the application to set aside the sale on various grounds. The application was dismissed for default, and the subsequent application to restore it was also dismissed. The first appeal regarding the restoration of the petition is deemed incompetent based on legal precedent. The second appeal challenges the dismissal of the application to set aside the sale. The main contention is whether the appellant, being an adjudicated insolvent, has the right to apply to set aside the sale under Order 21, Rule 90 of the Civil Procedure Code. Legal precedents establish that the insolvency of the judgment-debtor does not per se render such applications incompetent.

Later, on November 24, 1396, Lakhpati sold the entire mortgaged property to the defendant, Pandit Ram Autar Pande, for Rs. 41,100, leaving Rs. 40,000 with the vendee for payment of the money due to Jamna Das. Jamna Das sued for the sale of the mortgaged property and obtained a decree, but only for the sale of the zamindari, excluding the mortgagee rights. As the sale of the zamindari property was insufficient to satisfy the decree, Jamna Das obtained a decree under Section 90 of the Transfer of Property Act against the judgment-debtors other than the present defendant. Alleging that a balance of Rs. 33,009 still remained due, Jamna Das brought the present suit, claiming that Pandit Ram Autar Pande was a trustee for him because Rs. 40,000 out of Rs. 44,000 was left in his hands for payment of the plaintiff's debt. T"," The Court held that no trust was created in favor of the plaintiff, as he was not a party to the transaction, and the sale did not affect his rights to proceed against the mortgaged property.

"The judgment discusses a deed of confirmation and consent, referred to as a deed of relinquishment, that acts as a bar to a suit by Fateh Singh or his claimants for his share of the estate. The deed, although not legally described as estoppel, election, or equitable bar, is considered a bar based on the parties' acts and intentions. The deed is an endowment for religious purposes, and while the proportion of the estate given is exceptionally large, it could be valid within the limits permitted by law. The central question in the appeal is whether Fateh Singh, based on his conduct, could challenge the excessiveness of the endowment. The judgment emphasizes that no other reversioner's right to challenge the gift is in question. The court notes that the deed was almost contemporaneous with an attempt by the donor to benefit Fateh Singh through a will, suggesting a mutual arrangement. The principle established in Indian courts is that a person who consents or approves of an act cannot later make a claim inconsistent with that act"," The court finds that Fateh Singh, by joining in the deed, agreed not to claim his share of the reversion if he ever became entitled to it.

"The assessee, engaged in pawning and sarrafa business, faced reassessment for the years 1972-73 to 1976-77 due to non-filing of returns. The Income Tax Officer rejected certain cash deposits as unexplained, leading to assessment additions. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner granted relief for petty amounts but upheld the rejection of larger credits. The Income Tax Appellate Tribunal affirmed this decision, stating that Section 132(4A) presumption did not override Section 68 requirements for proving cash credits' genuineness.","The court ruled in favor of the Revenue, affirming that the presumption under Section 132(4A) applied only to search and seizure proceedings, not regular assessments. Thus, the burden remained on the assessee to establish the genuineness of cash credits under Section 68. Consequently, the additions made by the Income Tax Officer were upheld.",0,,"Key info:  The assessee, engaged in pawning and sarrafa business, faced reassessment for the years 1972-73 to 1976-77 due to non-filing of returns.

The case involves the interpretation of Section 115 of the Civil Procedure Code (C.P.C.) as amended by U.P. Amendment Act No. XXXI of 1978. The dispute arose regarding the maintainability of revisional jurisdiction of the High Court over orders passed by the District Court. A conflict emerged between decisions of the Supreme Court and the Full Bench of the Allahabad High Court regarding the scope of revisional power under Section 115.,"The Full Bench concluded that the decision of the Supreme Court in Qamaruddin's case, which held that revision against appellate orders of the District Court is maintainable under Section 115, did not accurately state the law. It was noted that the Supreme Court did not consider the U.P. Amendment Act and the earlier decisions affirming the Full Bench decision of the Allahabad High Court. Therefore, the Full Bench upheld the principle established by its earlier decision and rejected the interpretation provided by the Supreme Court.",0,,"Key info:  The case involves the interpretation of Section 115 of the Civil Procedure Code (C.P.C.) as amended by U.P.

"The defendant appealed against a judgment and decree that dismissed their appeal and decreed the plaintiff's suit for a mandatory injunction to vacate a room and refrain from its use. The plaintiff claimed to be the permanent lessee of a plot with a room, which the defendant occupied initially as a licensee, allegedly to be vacated once the defendant obtained alternative accommodation. Dispute arose when the defendant refused to vacate despite revocation of the license. The lower courts found the defendant to be a licensee, not a tenant, based on oral evidence and circumstances.","The appellate court found the lower courts' conclusions regarding the defendant's status as a licensee to be against the weight of evidence and law. It held that the defendant was a tenant, not a licensee, and thus, the suit for a mandatory injunction was not maintainable without terminating the tenancy. Additionally, the court determined that the plaintiff's suit was adequately stamped, and the defendant's plea for insufficiency of stamp duty was rejected. Consequently, the appellate court allowed the defendant's appeal, set aside the judgments of the lower courts, and dismissed the plaintiff's suit.",0,,"Key info:  The defendant appealed against a judgment and decree that dismissed their appeal and decreed the plaintiff's suit for a mandatory injunction to vacate a room and refrain from its use.

"Two Habeas Corpus Petitions were filed by individuals challenging their detention on the grounds that full particulars of the offences for which they were arrested were not communicated to them at the time of arrest, violating Section 50(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr. P. C.) and Article 22(1) of the Constitution. The respondents, police officials, submitted counter-affidavits stating that the grounds of arrest were indeed communicated to the petitioners. Additionally, the petitioners challenged the validity of their detention despite subsequent orders of remand.","The court dismissed both petitions, holding that the petitioners were detained in accordance with valid orders of remand passed by competent magistrates and judges. It emphasized that even if there were technical breaches at the time of arrest, subsequent valid orders of remand rendered the detention lawful. The court rejected the argument that any illegality in the arrest invalidated all subsequent proceedings, maintaining that habeas corpus could not be granted solely on the basis of technical breaches.

"Two writ petitions arose from proceedings under Section 17 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1923, stemming from the same accident resulting in the deaths of Safdar Miyan and Insar Ahmed. One petition (No. 37551/92) concerned a claim for compensation for the death of Safdar Miyan, while the other (No. 37550/92) concerned a claim for the death of Nihal Beg. Both claims were initially awarded compensation, but the insurance company, as the petitioner, contested the decision, arguing that the liability of the insurer was not properly considered. The main contention was whether the authority under the Workmen's Compensation Act had jurisdiction to review and fix the liability of the insurer.","The court upheld the jurisdiction of the Workmen's Compensation authority to review its decision and determine the liability of the insurer. It emphasized that the authority, exercising quasi-judicial jurisdiction, possessed the inherent power to review its orders, especially when justice demanded it.

"The petitioner, a manufacturer of audio cassettes, claimed credit for excise duty paid on certain inputs under the Modvat Scheme. When audio cassettes became exempt from excise duty, the petitioner adjusted their personal ledger account (PLA) by debiting the amount previously credited. Later, realizing this adjustment was without legal authority, they filed a refund claim, which was rejected as time-barred. The petitioner challenged this rejection, arguing that the debit entries were unauthorized and amounted to illegal recovery. However, the court found that the entries were in compliance with legal obligations, and the claim for refund was rightfully dismissed.","The court dismissed the petitioner's claim for refund, ruling it was time-barred and without merit.
