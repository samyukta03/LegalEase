1,"The case involves an appeal by special leave against an order of the High Court at Patna, which affirmed the conviction of the appellant by the Additional Sessions Judge, Arrah, under Section 147 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The appellant, along with 13 others, was charged with being a member of an unlawful assembly with the common object of dispossessing one Chulhan Tewari (the complainant) and assaulting and murdering one Nasiba Ahir and others. The prosecution alleged that the appellant led a group armed with a gun and lathis to dispossess the complainant of a piece of land. The appellant fired three shots from the gun, injuring several individuals, including Nasiba Ahir who later died in the hospital. The Additional Sessions Judge found that the apparent title to the land was in dispute and that neither party could claim the right of private defense to property. The judge also found that while the appellant's party used a gun, the complainant's party used lathis or brickbats, resulting in injuries on both sides. The judge convicted the appellant under Section 304, Part II, read with Section 149, and sentenced him to five years of rigorous imprisonment. The judge also found the appellant guilty of rioting under Section 147 but did not impose a separate sentence for that offense. The other 13 individuals charged were acquitted due to lack of proper identification. The appellant's petition for special leave to appeal was admitted by the Supreme Court, which considered three grounds: (1) whether there was an unlawful assembly, (2) whether the possession of the complainant was established, and (3) whether any member of the appellant's party was armed with a gun. The Supreme Court found that there was sufficient evidence to establish the existence of an unlawful assembly. However, it remanded the case to the High Court for rehearing because the High Court did not apply itself seriously to the question of possession, which was crucial to the case. The Supreme Court held that a clear finding on possession was necessary to determine the aggressor in the incident. In conclusion, the Supreme Court set aside the conviction and sentence of the appellant and remanded the case to the High Court for rehearing and disposal according to law, with a direction to record a definite finding on the question of possession.",1
2,"This case involves an appeal under Article 132(1) of the Constitution against a judgment and order of the Bombay High Court dated 1st September 1950, in Criminal Application No. 807 of 1950. The respondent was detained under the Preventive Detention Act (IV of 1950) on grounds of promoting acts of sabotage on railway and railway property in Greater Bombay. The respondent filed a habeas corpus petition contending that the government's aim was to lock up active trade unionists and that the grounds for detention were vague and did not mention specifics of the alleged sabotage. The High Court ordered the respondent's release, finding the grounds for detention to be insufficient. The appellant, the Attorney-General, appealed this decision. The Supreme Court, in its judgment delivered by Kania C.J., held that preventive detention orders must be based on the satisfaction of the Central or State Government and that the grounds, while not required to be exhaustive, must be connected in some manner with the objects to be prevented. The Court stated that it was not for the court to substitute its decision for that of the government, as long as the grounds were such that a rational human being could consider them connected to the objects to be prevented.",0
3,"This case involves an appeal by the State of West Bengal against a judgment of a Full Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Calcutta, which quashed the conviction of the respondent by the Special Court established under the West Bengal Special Courts Ordinance, 1949. The respondent and 49 others were charged with various offences allegedly committed during a raid on a factory known as the Jessop Factory at Dum Dum. They were convicted and sentenced by the Special Court, but the respondent challenged the jurisdiction of the Special Court, arguing that the enabling provision under which the case was sent for trial was unconstitutional and violated the equal protection of laws guaranteed by Article 14 of the Constitution. The High Court, in a Full Bench decision, quashed the conviction and directed a new trial. The State of West Bengal appealed this decision. The Supreme Court noted that the West Bengal Special Courts Act, 1950, was enacted to provide for speedier trial of certain offences, and section 5 of the Act empowered the State Government to constitute Special Courts. The respondent relied on the US Supreme Court decisions in Truax v. Corrigan and Yick Wo v. Hopkins to argue that the Act violated equal protection under the law. However, the Supreme Court held that the Act did not violate Article 14, as it was applicable to a class of persons and was not administered in a discriminatory manner. The Court emphasized that the legislation aimed at preventing heinous crimes must be interpreted in a manner that the common man can understand and appreciate, to ensure faith and confidence in the legal system. The Court concluded that the Act did not violate the Constitution and dismissed the appeal, upholding the validity of the West Bengal Special Courts Act, 1950.",1
4," This	 is  the  ordinary  accepted
meaning	 of  the  word "" decree "" and  if  that	 meaning  is
attributed to the word "" decree "" occurring in section 18(1)
then clearly it cannot cover an order for possession  passed
under section 43 of the Presidency Small Cause Courts Act on
an application made under section 41 of that Act.
It is, however, urged that the word "" decree"" in -section 18
(1)  of	 Act XVII of 1950 should not be read in	 its  strict
sense.	It is said that although the word ""suit""  ordinarily
means  a proceeding instituted by a plaint, it is also	used
in  a wider sense so as to cover proceedings which  are	 not
instituted  by a plaint and, therefore., an adjudication  in
those  proceedings  which are also suits  in  that  extended
meaning	 may well be said to be a "" decree"".   Reference  is
made to the explanation of sub-section (1) of section 12  of
Act  XVII  of  1950, which expressly provides  that  in	 the
proviso to sub-section (1) the term ""suit"" does not  include
proceeding  under Chapter VII of the Presidency Small  Cause
Courts	Act,  1882, and it is urged  that  this	 explanation
inferentially means that the word "" suit "" occurring in	 the
other sections of Act XVII of 1950 may include a  proceeding
under  Chapter VII of the Presidency Small Cause Courts	 Act
and,  therefore, an order made on such a proceeding  may  be
described  as  an adjudication in a suit and,  therefore,  a
decree.	  It is not quite clear how this inference, even  if
it  can	 be  properly drawn, can have  any  bearing  on	 the
construction  of  the word ""decree"" in	sub-section  (1)  of
section	 18 of the Act XVII of 1960 where the word "" suit  ""

has  made a mistake.  The Court must proceed on the  footing
that  the  Legislature intended what it has said.   Even  if
there  is  some	 defect	 in  the  phraseology  used  by	 the
Legislature the Court cannot, as pointed out in Crawford  v.
Spooner(1),  aid the Legislature's defective phrasing of  an
Act or add and amend or, by   construction,	make	  up
deficiencies which are left in	   the	 Act.	Even   where
there is a casus omissus, it is, as	said by Lord Russell
of Killowen in Hansraj Gupta v.	   Official  Liquidator	  of
Dehra  Dun-Mussoorie  Electric Tramway Co.,  Ltd.  (2),	 for
others than the Courts to remedy the defect.  In our view it
is  not right to give to the word "" decree"" a meaning  other
than its ordinary accepted meaning and we are bound to	say,
in  spite  of our profound respect for the opinions  of	 the
learned	 Judges	 who decided them, that	 the  several  cases
relied on by the respondent were not correctly decided.
Reference was made, in, course of argument, to section 6  of
the  West Bengal Act LXII of 1950.  That section  refers  to
orders or decrees made between the commencement of Act	XVII
of 1950 and Act LXII of 1950, i.e., between the 30th  March,
1950,  and  the	 30th November, 1950, and  cannot  have	 any
application to the order for possession made in this case on
the 27th February, 1950.

For reasons stated above this appeal must be allowed and the
order  made  by the High Court should be set aside  and	 the
respondents' application under section 18 (1) of Act XVII of
1950  should be dismissed and we order accordingly.  In	 the
circumstances  of  this case we make no order  as  to  costs
except	that  the  parties  should  bear  their	 own   costs
throughout.

Appeal allowed.

5,"The case involves four consolidated appeals against a judgment of the High Court of Punjab regarding income-tax investigation proceedings. The appellants, partners in a firm, claimed that the investigation extended beyond the permissible period. They filed petitions under articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution, but no order was passed due to pending law changes. The investigation was challenged on various grounds, including the death of a partner, the addition of a new partner, and the dissolution of the original firm. The appellants sought relief under the Taxation on Income (Investigation Commission) Act, 1947, but the High Court dismissed the petitions. The Supreme Court upheld the High Court's decision, stating that the jurisdiction under article 226 is discretionary and the remedy provided by the Act should be exhausted first.",0
6,"The petitioner, a student at Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Medical College in Indore, challenged the institution's rule that imposed a capitation fee on students not resident in Madhya Bharat while exempting residents. He argued that the rule violated articles 14 and 15(1) of the Constitution. The respondent, the State of Madhya Bharat, contended that the rule was based on residence, not place of birth, and was thus not discriminatory. The Supreme Court held that the rule, as modified in 1952, did not violate article 15(1) as it was based on residence, not place of birth. However, the Court found that the rule still discriminated against the petitioner based on regional domicile, which was not a reasonable ground for classification. The Court allowed the petition, holding that the State could not levy capitation fees on the petitioner based on the rule.",1
7,"These appeals stem from an order of discharge issued by the Subordinate Judge-Magistrate of Dhanbad under section 494 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, allowing the withdrawal of the Public Prosecutor from a prosecution against Mahesh Desai, one of the accused in a murder case. The prosecution alleged that Desai abetted the murder of Nand Kumar Chaubey during a riot. The Public Prosecutor sought withdrawal of the case against Desai, citing lack of evidence to establish a prima facie case. The Magistrate granted the withdrawal, which was upheld by the Sessions Judge on revision. However, the Chief Justice of the High Court set aside the withdrawal, directing the Magistrate to record evidence and determine if a prima facie case existed against Desai. The State challenged this decision, arguing that the Chief Justice's view was based on an erroneous understanding of the law.",1
8,"The appellants, Maitland Craig Lubricants Ltd. and H. J. Leach, filed a suit in the Bombay High Court for damages for conversion against the respondents. The suit was based on an agreement between Leach and the respondents, under which Leach was given an exclusive right to sell lubricants within certain territories. The respondents cancelled the agreement, alleging that Leach had assigned his rights to the first appellant without their consent. The respondents refused to deliver goods ordered by them on behalf of the appellants after the cancellation. The trial court decreed the suit, but the appellate court held that the title to the goods vested in the respondents until they endorsed the shipping documents in favor of the appellants, which had not been done. The appellate court allowed the appeal and dismissed the suit.",0
9,"M. K. Nambiar and G. Gopalakrishnan, representing petitioners in Petition No. 91 of 1957, argued that the Working Journalists Act, 1955, is unconstitutional as it violates fundamental rights under Articles 19 (1) (a), 19 (1) (g), 14, and 32 of the Constitution. They contended that the Act restricts freedom of speech and expression, impairs the ability of the press to function, and places unreasonable restraints on the freedom to carry on business.	",1
10,"The case involved the validity of the scheme of nationalization of the State Transport Service formulated by the State Government and the consequential orders made by it. The court considered whether the Uttar Pradesh Transport Service (Development) Act, 1955, was void under Art. 254(1) of the Constitution after the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 1956, was passed. The court also discussed the adequacy of compensation provided under the Act.",0
11,"The case involved a writ petition filed by the Hospital Mazdoor Sabha, a trade union registered under the Industrial Trade Unions Act XIV of 1926, and two of its members, Mrs. Vatsala Narayan and Mrs. Ruth Isaac, against the State of Bombay. The respondents, Mrs. Narayan and Mrs. Isaac, were employed as Ward servants in the J. J. group of Hospitals. Their services were terminated, and two State servants who were discharged from the Civil Supplies Department were appointed in their place.

The respondents challenged the termination of their services, alleging that it was void as it did not comply with the mandatory provisions of Sections 25F and 25H of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (the Act). They filed a writ petition seeking a writ of mandamus directing the appellant to reinstate them in their posts.

The appellant, the State of Bombay, contested the petition on several grounds. It argued that the termination orders were not void and that the writ application was misconceived because the J. J. group of Hospitals did not constitute an industry, making the relevant provisions of the Act inapplicable.

The petition was first heard by Tendolkar J., who dismissed it, holding that even if the relevant provisions of the Act were applicable, the termination orders were not void. He also held that the question about the application of Section 25H did not arise.

The matter was then taken to the Court of Appeal, which held that the termination orders had not complied with the mandatory provisions of Section 25F and were therefore invalid. The Court of Appeal also held that the J. J. group of Hospitals constituted an industry within the meaning of the Act. It allowed the writ petition and issued a writ of mandamus against the appellant.",1
12,"The petitioner, convicted for various offences, claimed to have served his sentence and sought release. He argued that with remissions earned, he had served over 15 years. The State, conceding the remissions, contended he could only be considered for release after completing 15 years of actual imprisonment. The Court noted that before 1955, a sentence of transportation for life could be served as rigorous imprisonment for life in India. However, post-1955, such a convict would be treated as undergoing rigorous imprisonment for the same term. The remissions earned would be credited towards the term, but unless the sentence was commuted or remitted, the convict was bound to serve life imprisonment. The Court held that as the petitioner's sentence had not been fully remitted by the appropriate authority, he had not acquired the right to release.",0
13,"The appellant, who had taken an assignment of a life insurance policy on the life of Mahajan Deolal, demanded payment from the insurance company after Deolal's death. The company repudiated the claim, alleging that Deolal had made deliberate misstatements and fraudulent suppressions of material information in the proposal form and personal statement. The appellant filed a suit, which was decreed by the trial court but dismissed by the High Court. The appellant appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that if the policy was valid in its inception, it could not be invalidated by assignment to him. The Court held that if Deolal had been guilty of fraud, the appellant, holding an assignment of the policy, could not stand on a better footing than Deolal himself. As the contract was vitiated by fraud, the appellant could not claim the benefit of it. The Court also held that the appellant was not entitled to a refund of the money paid to the company. The appeal was dismissed.",0
14,"This is an appeal by certificate granted by the High Court of Calcutta under Art. 134 (1) (c) of the Constitution of India. The appellant filed a complaint alleging murder against respondent No. 1. After a judicial inquiry, the Sub-Divisional Magistrate dismissed the complaint without recording reasons. The High Court set aside the order of dismissal and directed further inquiry. The Supreme Court held that the absence of reasons in the Magistrate's order prejudiced the complainant's right to move a revisional court, making the order a nullity. The Court allowed the appeal, set aside the High Court's order, and directed that there be no legal impediment to the inquiry against the respondent.",1

16,"The appeal raised the question of whether an appeal lies under cl. 10 of the Letters Patent for the High Court of Lahore, to a Division Bench of the Punjab High Court against a judgment passed by a single Judge of the said High Court in a second appeal under s. 39 of the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958. The appellant, South Asia Industries (Private) Ltd., had taken a lease of a property from Messrs. Allen Berry & Co. Private Ltd., which was later assigned to them. The owners of the property filed for eviction of the appellant on the ground of unauthorized assignment. The appeal was dismissed by the Rent Control Tribunal and the High Court, leading to the present appeal.",0
17,"The case involved a dispute regarding the interest of a partner in partnership assets, including movable and immovable property, under s. 17(1) of the Registration Act, 1908. The partnership between two joint Hindu families, the Addanki family and the Bhaskara family, was for the business of hulling rice and decorticating groundnuts. The plaintiffs sought a declaration that the suit properties belonged to them and for a division of the same. The defendants, members of the Bhaskara family, contended that the partnership was dissolved in 1936, and therefore, the plaintiffs had no cause of action.",0
18,"The appellant, Raghubans Dubey, challenged an order summoning him as an accused in a criminal case before the Sessions Judge, contending that the Magistrate had no jurisdiction to summon him as the Sub-divisional Magistrate had already dismissed a protest petition on the same matter. The Sessions Judge rejected this argument, holding that the Magistrate could summon any person against whom there was sufficient evidence. The appellant then filed a criminal revision before the Patna High Court, arguing that summoning him based on a petition of complaint would result in a separate complaint case. The High Court disagreed, holding that the case was instituted based on a police report, and the order of the Magistrate did not amount to taking cognizance of an offence. The High Court also ruled that the Magistrate did not summon the appellant only on the grounds considered by the Sub-divisional Magistrate.",0
19,"The petitions and the civil appeal challenged an order of the State of Madras regarding the selection of candidates for admission to the First Year integrated M.B.B.S. Course. Rule 5 of the Rules provided for reservation for socially and educationally backward classes, defined as specified in Group III of the revised Appendix 17-A to the Madras Educational Rules. The petitioners argued that the selection process was not in accordance with the University Act and the Rules framed thereunder. The High Court dismissed the petitions and upheld the selection process. The Supreme Court partly allowed the petitions and struck down Rule 8 of the Rules, which dealt with districtwise allocation. The Court held that the Government was entitled to frame rules for admission to medical colleges controlled by it, subject to the rules of the university as to eligibility and qualifications. The selection for the current year stood, but Rule 8 would not be enforced for future selections.",1

21,"This case involves an assessee's appeal against the High Court of Patna's judgment dismissing its writ petition under Arts 226 and 227 of the Indian Constitution. The assessee, a partnership firm, had construction contracts under the Railways and the Government. For the assessment year 1960-61, it was asked by the Income-tax Officer to produce its books of account and other relevant papers. After an enquiry, the assessee's total income was assessed. Subsequently, the Income-tax Officer issued a notice under s. 148 of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1961, to re-assess the income for the said assessment year. The assessee challenged the validity of the notice on various grounds, including non-compliance with the requirements of s. 151(2) of the Act. The Supreme Court found that the notice was invalid as it did not comply with the requirements of s. 151(2) of the Act, which states that no notice shall be issued under Section 148 after the expiry of four years from the end of the relevant assessment year unless the Commissioner is satisfied on the reasons recorded by the Income-tax Officer that it is a fit case for the issue of such notice. The Court held that the Income-tax Officer did not have reasons to believe that the income had escaped assessment, as required by s. 147 of the Act. The Court set aside the High Court's order and quashed the impugned notice. The respondent was ordered to pay the costs of the appellant both in the Supreme Court and the High Court.",1
22,"The appellant, a professor at a medical college, was convicted under the Prevention of Corruption Act and IPC sections for his involvement in a research project. The prosecution alleged that he misappropriated funds by obtaining a draft for the purchase of a distillation apparatus but did not use it for the intended purpose. However, the Court found that the appellant had genuinely tried to purchase the apparatus but faced difficulties in obtaining it. The Court noted that the appellant's actions were irregular but did not indicate criminal intent. The Court also observed that the appellant may have been targeted due to hostility from the Dean of the Medical College. Consequently, the Court acquitted the appellant of all charges, stating that he was innocent.",1
23,"The appeal arose from a decision of the Calcutta High Court on a question of law regarding the interpretation of section 271(1)(a)(i) of the Income Tax Act. The Tribunal sought the High Court's opinion on whether the penalty should be determined based on the tax assessed under section 143 of the Act or the amount payable under section 156. The Revenue argued that the penalty should be based on the tax assessed, while the assessee and interveners contended that it should be based on the amount payable under section 156. The High Court considered the language of the provision and previous decisions, noting that different interpretations had been adopted by various High Courts. Ultimately, the Court held that the expression ""the amount of the tax, if any, payable by him"" in section 271(1)(a)(i) referred to the tax payable by the assessee, and not the tax assessed. The Court emphasized the need to interpret taxing provisions in a manner that favors the assessee when two reasonable constructions are possible. Therefore, the appeal was dismissed, affirming the interpretation that the penalty should be based on the tax payable by the assessee.",0
24,"This case involves a dispute over inheritance rights to a property left by Lachman, who died in 1948, leaving behind three daughters. The appellant, Kale, is the son of one of the daughters, Musamat Tikia. The U.P. Tenancy Act, 1939, applied, stating that only unmarried daughters inherit the property. Disputes arose regarding the inheritance, with one daughter, Musamat Ram Pyari, marrying in 1955. The appellant claimed sole inheritance rights after her marriage. After various legal proceedings and a compromise, the Revenue authorities were directed to attest the mutation of names in accordance with the family arrangement between the parties.",1
25,"This appeal under Article 136 of the Constitution was filed by two appellants against the judgment of the Bombay High Court, which dismissed their appeal against the judgment of the Additional Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal for Greater Bombay. The Tribunal had confirmed an award in favor of the respondents and directed the Tribunal to decide the liability of the Insurance Company, limiting its liability to Rs. 20,000 under section 110E of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939. The case involved an accident where the respondent, Dr. Balkrishna Ramchandra Nayan, was driving his car and was hit by a truck owned by the appellants, causing injuries to him and his nurse. Dr. Nayan claimed Rs. 3 lakhs in damages. The owners of the truck denied negligence and refuted the claim. The Tribunal found the truck owner liable for negligence and upheld the damages awarded to Dr. Nayan.",0
26,"This case discusses the evolution of the doctrine regarding the adjudgment of whether a statute offends a fundamental right. It mentions the cases of A. K. Gopalan v. State of Madras and R.C. Cooper v. Union of India, highlighting the shift from the doctrine of intended and real effect to the doctrine that the object and form of the State action alone determine the extent of protection that may be claimed by an individual. The test applied since R.C. Cooper's case is to determine the direct and inevitable consequence or effect of the impugned state action on the fundamental right of the petitioner. It emphasizes that the pith and substance doctrine looks at the object and subject matter of the state action, while in testing the validity of state action with reference to fundamental rights, the Courts must consider the direct and inevitable consequence of the State action.",0
27,"The appellant filed a Writ Petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India in the Court of the Judicial Commissioner, Manipur, challenging orders of the Chief Commissioner of Manipur permitting the 'settlement' of part of a public road on respondents, which allegedly prevented the petitioner's free access to the public road from his adjoining land. The Writ petition was initially allowed by the learned Judicial Commissioner but was later reviewed and dismissed by his successor. The appellant appealed, arguing that the Judicial Commissioner acted without jurisdiction in reviewing the order made by his predecessor. The Judicial Commissioner gave two reasons for the review, which the appellant contended were not valid grounds for review.",1
28,"The petitioner, Dr. Ramesh, a medical graduate from the Madras University, applied for admission to the University of Delhi's postgraduate Dermatology course but was denied admission due to a rule reserving 70% of the seats for Delhi graduates. The remaining 30% was open to all, including graduates from other universities. The petitioner challenged the rule as violative of Articles 14 to 16 of the Constitution, seeking admission to the course. The University of Delhi justified the reservation, citing the need to counter similar practices by other universities that favored their own alumni. The Supreme Court directed the petitioner to be admitted to the postgraduate degree course in Dermatology for the current year and ordered the University to appoint a time-bound committee to investigate the justification and quantum of reservation at the postgraduate level, considering equality of opportunity for every Indian. The committee was to make recommendations on university-based reservations and the implementation modus operandi, with a report to be considered for admissions for the next year. The Court expressed concern over the tendency of universities to act as insulated islands of education, emphasizing the need for integrated unity and equal opportunity in higher education to prevent provincialism from eroding the integrity of India.",1

30,"A landlord, frustrated by civil court rulings, filed a frivolous criminal complaint against tenants, alleging offenses under Sections 193, 199, and 201 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The complaint pertained to false statements made during allotment proceedings before a Rent Control Officer.The premises in question had a history of legal disputes, including a pending suit for sale. Chandrapal Singh, one of the tenants, had occupied part of the premises since 1972.The Rent Control Officer, acting as a tribunal, had ruled in favor of Chandrapal Singh in the allotment proceedings, although there were disputes over the area vacated by the previous tenant.The complainant, an advocate, alleged false statements in affidavits filed during the allotment proceedings. However, the court noted that mere rejection of evidence does not automatically make it false.The court quashed the proceedings initiated by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, holding that there was insufficient evidence to support charges under Sections 193, 199, and 201 of the IPC. The complainant's actions were deemed an abuse of the legal system.",1
31,"The case involved lifers (prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment) seeking consideration for premature release under the Punjab Jail Manual. Counsel for the lifers argued that they should be eligible for release after serving a specific period of their sentence, as per the Manual. They contended that executive instructions issued by the State Government couldn't override the Manual's provisions.

The State argued that the Manual's provisions were themselves executive instructions and could be amended by subsequent instructions. They relied on instructions issued in 1971 and 1976, which required longer periods of imprisonment before consideration for release.

The court examined the history of the Manual and noted that its provisions were based on executive instructions from the Government of India. They found that the Manual's provisions were not statutory rules but could be amended by fresh executive instructions.

Ultimately, the court rejected the lifers' contentions, stating that they were bound by the 1971 and 1976 instructions. However, it ruled in favor of two specific petitioners who had already served the required period for consideration under the 1971 instructions.",0
32,"These appeals involve a point of law regarding the interpretation of the term 'wilful default' in the Tamil Nadu Buildings (Lease and Rent Control) Act, 1960. The court heard arguments from both parties and reviewed several authorities. The cases involved different situations where tenants were accused of wilful default in rent payment, leading to eviction lawsuits. The court examined the facts of each case and the relevant provisions of the Acts in question. The Acts varied in their treatment of wilful default, with some explicitly mentioning it and others not. The Tamil Nadu Act included an explanation that clarified the criteria for determining wilful default. The court considered the impact of this explanation on the proviso and discussed the purpose and interpretation of explanations in statutory provisions. The court also discussed the general provisions of Rent Acts in different states and how they handle defaults and eviction procedures. Overall, the court analyzed the legal principles and statutory provisions to determine the outcome of the appeals.

Shamimbanu and her husband Mohmad Shafi, who had eloped and married, were staying in a lodge in Nagpur when the incident occurred. The respondent, accompanied by a constable, took them to the police station in the middle of the night, where he separated the couple. The respondent then took Shamimbanu to a room in the police station, flirted with her, slapped her, and demanded sexual favors. Later, he took her to a hotel room, raped her twice, and threatened her not to complain.
Upon returning to the police station, Mohmad Shafi informed the police about the rape, leading to an investigation and the charge sheeting of the respondent. During the trial, the respondent denied the accusations and claimed that he had to place Mohmad Shafi in the lock-up due to family issues. However, the trial court found the respondent guilty based on the evidence presented.
The High Court, on appeal, acquitted the respondent, citing lack of corroboration in Shamimbanu's testimony and discrepancies in her statements.",1
35,"The assessee in this case is a civil construction company engaged in various projects, including dams, irrigation projects, water supply plants, etc., both in India and overseas. The company executed several contracts, including a dam and irrigation project in Libya, a fibre-board factory in Iraq, and the Karkh Water Supply Project in Baghdad, among others. The company obtained approval from the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) under Section 80-O of the Income Tax Act for some of these contracts, entitling it to certain deductions.

However, for the assessment year 1983-84, the Income Tax department disputed the deductions claimed by the assessee. The Inspecting Assistant Commissioner (IAC) denied the deductions under Section 80-O, stating that the contracts fell under Section 80-HHB, and even under that section, the conditions for exemption were not met.

On appeal, the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) partially upheld the IAC's decision but allowed the assessee an opportunity to present its claim under Section 80-HHB.

The Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) also supported the CIT's decision. However, during the appeal process, the CBDT issued a letter modifying its earlier approval, extending it beyond the initial assessment year. The ITAT referred the matter to the High Court, which concluded that the receipts from the contracts did not qualify for deductions under Section 80-O and were instead covered under Section 80-HHB.",0
36,"The case involves an appeal by the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (appellant) against a judgment by the High Court of Kerala in M.F.A. No. 661 of 1986. The appeal concerns a fatal accident action resulting from a motor accident involving a bus owned by the appellant. The accident occurred on February 19, 1984, at Plamood Junction at Pullad on Thiruvalla-Kothancherry in the State of Kerala, resulting in the death of Thomas Philip, aged 38.

The Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal initially awarded compensation of Rs 58,760 to the claimants (parents, widow, and children of the deceased). However, the High Court of Kerala enhanced the compensation to Rs 2,64,000, taking into account various factors such as loss of dependency, special damages for funeral expenses, journey to the hospital, treatment expenses, loss of future earnings, etc.

The appellant appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the compensation awarded was excessive and not in line with established principles. The appellant contended that the loss of dependency could not exceed a certain amount based on the deceased's income, and the total compensation awarded by the High Court was unjustified.",1
37,"Hetal Parekh, an 18-year-old school-going girl, was raped and murdered. The appellant, a security guard at the building where the crime occurred, was found guilty of rape and murder based on witness testimonies, recovery of stolen items from his house, and his absconding after the crime. The prosecution's evidence conclusively connected the appellant to the crime. The Court upheld the appellant's conviction under Sections 302 (murder), 376 (rape), and 380 (theft) of the Indian Penal Code.",1
38,"The case involved an accident on May 20, 1980, where the appellant, R.D. Hattangadi, met with an accident while traveling in an Ambassador car on the Karwar-Mangalore Road. The accident resulted in the death of the car driver and serious injuries to Hattangadi, leaving him paralyzed below the waist.

The car was owned by M/s Pest Control (India) Pvt. Ltd., and the motor lorry involved in the accident was owned by Madhav Bolar. Both vehicles were insured. Hattangadi filed a claim petition seeking compensation for his injuries.

The Accident Claim Tribunal awarded compensation to Hattangadi, holding the drivers of both vehicles negligent. The Tribunal directed the car insurer to pay the compensation. However, on appeal, the High Court modified the compensation amount, reducing it significantly.

Hattangadi appealed to the Supreme Court seeking enhancement of the compensation awarded by the Tribunal.",1
39,"The statement discusses a case where the prosecutrix has testified to being raped, and the court is analyzing the evidence presented. The court finds the prosecutrix to be a reliable witness with no discrepancies in her testimony. The medical evidence, including the examination by a lady doctor and the presence of semen on slides, corroborates the prosecutrix's account. The court dismisses the trial court's conclusion that the prosecutrix was habituated to sexual intercourse based on medical evidence and finds it irresponsible. The court also refutes the trial court's belief that the case was fabricated out of enmity, pointing out inconsistencies in the accused's claims and lack of evidence supporting enmity between the families involved. The court emphasizes the seriousness of false accusations of rape and the implausibility of the prosecutrix and her family jeopardizing their reputation for petty reasons. Overall, the court finds the accused guilty based on the corroborated testimony of the prosecutrix and dismisses the trial court's faulty conclusions.

40,"The assessee, a Muslim lady aged about 20 years during the relevant assessment year, purchased land in Ernakulam in 1967 and 1968. The Income-tax Officer rejected her explanation for the source of funds, making additions to her income. Shri Ranbir Chandra, representing the Revenue, argued that Section 69 should be interpreted mandatorily, treating the investment value as income once the explanation is rejected.",0
41,"This case involves an employee (referred to as ""the respondent"") who was accused of sexual harassment and attempted molestation of a female subordinate employee (""Miss X"") in the organization where he held a superior position. The allegations against the respondent were substantiated through an internal inquiry process, and he was subsequently removed from service by the disciplinary authority.

The respondent challenged his removal from service before the High Court, arguing that the punishment was disproportionate to the alleged offense. The High Court, while acknowledging the occurrence and the inappropriate behavior of the respondent, took a lenient view and directed his reinstatement in service without back wages.

However, the decision of the High Court was appealed, and the Division Bench upheld the disciplinary action taken against the respondent, reinstating the punishment of removal from service. The Division Bench emphasized the seriousness of the offense of sexual harassment in the workplace and the need to maintain a safe and respectful working environment, especially for female employees.",1
42,"The respondent, a superior officer in the organization, was found guilty of molesting and attempting to physically assault Miss X, a subordinate employee. Despite her protests, the respondent pressured Miss X to accompany him to a hotel for dictation, where he made unwelcome sexual advances. The departmental authorities, after considering the evidence, removed the respondent from service due to his actions, which were deemed subversive of good discipline and created a hostile working environment for Miss X and other female employees.",1
43,"The case involves a motor accident in which a jeep overturned due to the bursting of its front tire, resulting in the death of a pedestrian named Haji Mohammad Hanif. The widow and children of the deceased filed a claim petition before the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal seeking compensation. However, both the Tribunal and the High Court dismissed their claim, stating that there was no negligence or rashness on the part of the jeep driver.

The appellants appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the owner of the jeep should be held liable for compensation under the principle of strict liability propounded in Rylands vs. Fletcher. The Supreme Court, after considering relevant provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act and precedents, held that even if there is no negligence on the part of the driver or owner, compensation can still be claimed for accidents involving motor vehicles. The Court also discussed the applicability of the Rule in Rylands vs. Fletcher to motor accident cases.

The Court concluded that the claimants were entitled to compensation and fixed the amount based on the structured formula provided in the Motor Vehicles Act. Additionally, the Court directed the insurance company to pay the compensation amount along with simple interest.",1

The petitioner was detained based on a solitary instance of robbery.

The petitioner argued that the solitary instance mentioned in the grounds of detention was not of sufficient magnitude to disturb public order, and his detention violated his fundamental rights under Articles 21 and 22(5) of the Constitution of India.

The State, represented by the Commissioner of Police, contended that the petitioner was involved in multiple cases of theft and robbery, and his detention was necessary to prevent him from engaging in similar activities in the future, which would disturb public order.",1
45,"This case involves two criminal appeals challenging an order made by the High Court of Judicature at Patna granting bail to the respondent in Sessions Trial No. 976 of 1999 pending before the CBI court. The respondent is charged with offenses under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Arms Act.

The respondent had filed multiple bail applications, all of which were either rejected by the High Court or overturned by the Supreme Court in earlier appeals. Despite this, the respondent filed a ninth bail application, which was granted by the High Court on the grounds of prolonged incarceration and delay in trial proceedings.

The appellants argued that the High Court ignored previous findings of the Supreme Court and failed to consider the seriousness of the charges and the respondent's behavior during previous periods of bail. They contended that the grant of bail was unwarranted.

The respondent's counsel argued that the right to liberty is fundamental, and successive bail applications are permissible. They asserted that the High Court properly considered the evidence and concluded that there was no prima facie case against the respondent.

The Supreme Court examined whether previous bail applications had addressed the existence of a prima facie case against the respondent and the evidentiary value of a retracted confession. They found that the High Court's decision did not adequately consider these issues, leading to the granting of bail based on improper grounds.",0
46,"The case revolves around the death of Bhimabai, who was allegedly subjected to harassment by her husband and mother-in-law (the accused) for dowry. Bhimabai's father testified that she had complained about ill-treatment and demands for money from her parental home. On the day of her death, Bhimabai was found dead with froth coming out of her mouth, indicating poisoning. The post-mortem examination confirmed insecticide poisoning as the cause of death.

The prosecution charged the accused under Sections 498-A, 304-B, and 306 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The trial court acquitted them of charges under Sections 498-A and 306 but convicted them under Section 304-B, leading to a sentence of 7 years of rigorous imprisonment. The High Court upheld the conviction.

However, the Supreme Court examined the evidence and concluded that the essential element of dowry demand, as defined by the Dowry Prohibition Act, was not established. The alleged demand for money was for domestic expenses and manure, not directly linked to the marriage. Consequently, the conviction under Section 304-B IPC was set aside, and the appellants were acquitted.

47,"In this case, disputes arose between the appellant and R.G. Bhat regarding their business dealings. As a result, the power of attorney granted by the appellant to R.G. Bhat was cancelled. Subsequently, a cheque issued by the appellant was dishonored, leading to a legal dispute. The complainant, who was the brother-in-law of R.G. Bhat, alleged that the appellant had committed an offense under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act by issuing a bounced cheque.

The trial court, as well as the appellate court, found the appellant guilty based on the presumption under Section 139 of the Act, which states that the issuance of a bounced cheque creates a mandatory presumption against the issuer. The courts primarily relied on the complainant's evidence and the appellant's failure to present a rebuttal.

However, the High Court, in its revisional jurisdiction, held that while the presumption under Section 139 extends to the issuance of the cheque for consideration, it does not presume the existence of a debt. The High Court found that the appellant had failed to discharge his initial burden of proof, but it also criticized the lower courts for not properly considering the appellant's defense and the overall factual circumstances of the case.",1
48,"The Union of India filed an appeal against the order of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad, which suspended the sentence and granted bail to the respondent who was convicted under Sections 8/27A and 8/29 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (NDPS Act). The trial court had found the respondent guilty of financing and trading in heroin. Despite the conviction, the High Court granted bail to the respondent.

The Union of India argued that the High Court erred in granting bail without considering the mandatory provisions of Section 37 of the NDPS Act. The section imposes restrictions and conditions for granting bail in cases under the NDPS Act.

The respondent contended that the High Court's order should not be interfered with, as it was discretionary and within the Court's jurisdiction.

The Supreme Court observed that the High Court had overlooked the requirements of Section 37 of the NDPS Act while granting bail. Section 37 lays down specific conditions for granting bail in NDPS cases, including giving an opportunity to the Public Prosecutor to oppose the release and ensuring that there are reasonable grounds to believe the accused is not guilty and will not commit any offense while on bail.

The Court held that the circumstances cited by the High Court for granting bail were not sufficient to satisfy the mandatory requirements of Section 37. Therefore, the High Court's order was unsustainable.",1
49,"In this case, the main issue revolves around the interpretation of Section 147 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, specifically concerning the concept of ""change of opinion."" The question at hand is whether the concept of ""change of opinion"" remains relevant after the amendment of Section 147 by the Direct Tax Laws (Amendment) Act, 1987.

Prior to the 1987 amendment, Section 147 allowed for reassessment based on specific conditions. However, post-amendment, only one condition remained, which was if the Assessing Officer had reason to believe that income had escaped assessment. This change widened the power of the Assessing Officer to reopen assessments.

The court emphasized the importance of interpreting the term ""reason to believe"" in a manner that prevents arbitrary use of power by the Assessing Officer. It stated that the concept of ""change of opinion"" acts as a check against abuse of power and should be treated as an inherent test.

The court also highlighted the distinction between the power to review and the power to reassess, noting that the Assessing Officer does not have the authority to review assessments but can only reassess them based on certain preconditions.

The judgment further discussed the legislative history and the reasons behind the reintroduction of the expression ""reason to believe"" and the removal of the term ""opinion"" in Section 147.

Ultimately, the court dismissed the civil appeals filed by the Department, affirming that there was no merit in their arguments. The case was dismissed with no order as to costs.",0
50,"The petitioner, a company manufacturing cigarettes, availed partial excise duty exemption under various notifications until the withdrawal notification (284/82-C.E.) was issued by the Central Government. The withdrawal notification rescinded the exemption, effective from November 30, 1982. However, the petitioner claimed that the withdrawal notification was only made available to the public on December 8, 1982. The petitioner contested that the withdrawal should only be effective from the date it was made known to the public. The government argued that the notification's printing in the official gazette was sufficient for it to take effect. The court examined legal precedents and concluded that for a notification to be effective, it must be made known to the public. As the withdrawal notification was not available to the public until December 8, 1982, it could only be considered effective from that date. Therefore, any duty collected before December 8, 1982, was deemed illegal, and the petitioner was entitled to a refund.",1

The plaintiff claimed that they had been jointly enjoying the land with the defendant, sharing the produce, until a recent dispute arose. The defendant admitted to the exchange but argued that the plaintiff had relinquished their share in 1877  and entered into an agreement to convey it for a specified amount. The Subordinate Judge found in favor of the plaintiff, ordering an apportionment of land and awarding them a share of the produce. However, the District Judge on appeal ruled that certain documents presented by the plaintiff were inadmissible as evidence. The High Court upheld the District Judge's decision regarding the admissibility of the documents but modified the decree to award specific lands to the plaintiff and dismissed the claim for profits of a certain year. Costs were awarded proportionally to both parties based on the decree modifications.",1

53,"The case involved a dispute over the maintainability of a suit brought by the decree-holder against the sons of the original debtor. The suit was to contest the order allowing the sale of ancestral property to satisfy a debt incurred by the father. The defendants argued that since a previous suit had resulted in a decree against the father and brother, the current suit was not maintainable. However, the court disagreed, stating that the previous suit did not address the specific issue of selling the interests of all family members in the ancestral property. Therefore, the decree-holder had the right to contest the order through a regular suit. Additionally, it was found that the debt was not for immoral purposes, making the sons' interests liable to sale unless they redeemed the unsold property. The court cited a ruling from the High Court of Calcutta to support its conclusion.",1

The plaintiffs seek a declaratory decree asserting their title to the property. The evidence presented regarding possession of the disputed lands is conflicting, with both parties presenting arguments and documents to support their claims. The plaintiffs argue that, as widows, they are entitled to succeed to the property unless the defendant can establish himself as the preferential heir. The defendant claims legitimacy based on a custom within his caste or family, which allegedly legitimizes children born out of wedlock under certain circumstances. However, the evidence for this custom is deemed insufficient by the court.",1

The appellant, her father, applied for probate, but the respondent, her husband, contested the authenticity of the will. The initial probate application was dismissed due to lack of instructions from the appellant's lawyer. Subsequently, the appellant made a second probate application, which was dismissed by the District Court on the grounds that a petition to set aside the previous order should have been filed first. The appellant then sought to set aside the order dismissing the original probate application, which was also rejected by the court.",1
57,"The case involves a dispute over the distribution of certain properties outlined in Schedule A. The plaintiff had previously accepted a monetary settlement for his share of the properties. The defendant argued that this settlement should be upheld and that the plaintiff should not be entitled to claim a share in specific items listed in Schedule A. Additionally, there was a dispute over the ownership of moveable assets.The court upheld the defendant's argument regarding the plaintiff's acceptance of a monetary settlement for his share of the properties. As a result, the plaintiff's claim to certain items listed in Schedule A was disallowed. The court confirmed the decision of the Subordinate Judge on other aspects of the case. The appellant (defendant) was awarded the costs of the appeal, while the award of costs in the lower courts remained unchanged.",0

The appellant sought to challenge this order, but a preliminary objection was raised that no appeal lies as the order does not constitute a judgment within the meaning of Article 5 of the Letters Patent. The appellant argued that the order should be considered a ""decree"" under Section 244 of the Civil Procedure Code, thus making it appealable.The court upheld the preliminary objection, ruling that the order refusing a stay of execution does not affect the merits of the question between the parties by determining any right or liability in dispute. Therefore, it does not qualify as a judgment under the Letters Patent. The appeal was dismissed, and costs were awarded against the appellant.",0
60,"This appeal arose from a suit brought on a foreign judgment obtained in the Court at Pondicherry, based on a promissory note executed by the appellant in favor of the respondent. The appellant contested the suit on the grounds that the District Court lacked jurisdiction and that the suit was not maintainable against the appellant at the time it was brought. The main argument was that the appellant was declared insolvent in Pondicherry, and therefore, no suit could be brought against him outside of French territory where the insolvency adjudication remained in force.The court ruled in favor of the appellant, finding that the District Court lacked jurisdiction over the appellant and that the suit was not maintainable against him due to his insolvency status in French territory.

The petitioner reiterated the merger and name change to ASCPL.

The reasons for reassessment included the claim of depreciation on computers and an alleged excess relief of tax credit under Section 90/91 of the Act. The petitioner objected to the assumption of jurisdiction, arguing that there was no new or tangible material warranting reassessment. The petitioner also contested the categorization of computers for depreciation purposes, stating that all computers should be classified under 'Machinery and Plant' for depreciation at 60%.",1
76,"Issue: The CIT(A) did not acknowledge that Explanation 5A to section u/s. 271(1)(c) of the Income Tax Act applies to the Assessee as additional income of Rs.1,58,98,570/- was disclosed in the return of income filed post-search, which was not declared in the original return of income.

Tribunal Decision: The Tribunal allowed the Revenue's appeal, restoring the penalty on two grounds: alleged non-disclosure of income and voluntary surrender of income. The Tribunal also restored the penalty for the disallowance of Rs.13,000/- under Section 40(a)(ia) of the Act.

Judicial Direction: It is decided that the AO should compute the penalty, considering the situation where no return was filed on 30.11.2006, while allowing credit for advance tax.",0
77,"The respondent filed two suits against the appellant: C.S. No. 831 of 2005 and C.S. No. 833 of 2005. These suits sought permanent injunctions against the appellant, preventing them from alienating or encumbering certain properties to third parties. The suits arose from agreements of sale dated 27.07.2005 between the parties. The appellant, citing a notice from the Central Excise Department, claimed inability to proceed with the sale transaction, leading to the respondent filing the suits for injunctions.

The court considered whether the suits should be rejected under Order VII Rule 11 of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC) due to the properties being outside the court's territorial jurisdiction. The court also addressed applications for amendment of the plaints and exclusion of certain periods for computing limitation. Ultimately, the court set aside previous orders and allowed the appeals, finding that the suits fell under the classification of ""suits for land"" and thus the court lacked territorial jurisdiction.",1
78,"The appellants, acting as legal representatives of the deceased K. Murugan, filed a claim petition seeking enhanced compensation for his death in an accident. The court re-quantified the compensation at Rs. 10,00,000/- and directed the second respondent to pay the enhanced amount of Rs. 6,50,000/- along with interest. Additionally, the appellants were directed to pay the deficit court fee on the enhanced compensation amount within two weeks. Since the first appellant (deceased) passed away during the appeal process, the second to fourth appellants were entitled to succeed to his estate equally and withdraw their respective shares. The court allowed the appeal and no costs were imposed.",1
79,"The accident occurred on 06.08.2009 at Pidagam Bridge, resulting in the death of one person and injuries to two others traveling in a Tata Indica Car. Claim petitions were filed, and the Tribunal adjudicated based on evidence provided. The Insurance Company argued that since the policy was an Act policy, there was no coverage for passengers. Relying on precedent cases, the court set aside the High Court's order and restored the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal's (M.A.C.T) decision. It emphasized that compensation should be sought from the vehicle owner, not the Insurance Company. The Civil Miscellaneous Appeal was allowed, permitting the claimants to execute the compensation award against the vehicle owner. The Insurance Company was allowed to withdraw the deposited amount with accrued interest. No costs were imposed.",0
80,"The accused was accused of beating his daughter with dangerous weapons and raping her multiple times, with the last incident occurring on 30.08.2013. Charges were framed under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Juvenile Justice Act. The prosecution presented 12 witnesses and 16 documents as evidence, including forensic reports. The accused pleaded not guilty and denied the allegations during questioning under Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

82,"The petitioner, accused No. 2 in a case arising from Crime No. 392/2021 of Kanjirappally Police Station, was granted statutory bail after the prosecution failed to file a final report within the statutory period. One condition of the bail was that the petitioner should not get involved in similar offenses during the bail period. However, the petitioner was later arrested in another case (Crime No. 521/2022) involving possession of ganja.",0
83,"The first accused was found traveling in a private bus and was allegedly in possession of MDMA. The police arrested him based on the information received and registered a case under the NDPS Act. The first accused implicated the fourth respondent, stating that they procured the contraband together from Bangalore with the help of others. The Sessions Judge granted bail to the fourth respondent, but the prosecution challenged this decision.",0
84,"The petitioner, who was the first accused in a case involving the transportation of ganja, was remanded to judicial custody on 24.11.2022. On the 180th day from the date of initial remand, an application was filed by the Public Prosecutor seeking an extension of detention for a further three months. However, the accused was not present when the application was considered by the Sessions Judge. The High Court held that the absence of the accused during the consideration of the application for detention beyond 180 days was illegal, as it went against the law laid down by the Supreme Court. Consequently, the order extending the detention period was deemed illegal, and the petitioner was granted default bail.",1
85,"The petitioner, the 24th accused in a case involving the transportation of a large quantity of heroin seized by the Coast Guard, was alleged to have facilitated the transportation and was subsequently arrested. The prosecution presented evidence suggesting the petitioner's involvement, including phone records and statements from bank employees. Despite arguments for bail, the court found that releasing the petitioner would be against the interest of society due to the seriousness of the charges and potential harm associated with drug trafficking. As a result, the bail application was dismissed.",0
86,"The case revolves around the legality of notifications issued under the Food Safety and Standards Act, particularly concerning the ban on the sale of certain products like pan masala or gutka. The appellants argued that such bans are unreasonable and violate their fundamental rights under Articles 14 and 19 of the Constitution. The court examined whether the impugned notifications exceeded the authority granted by the Act and whether they were consistent with constitutional principles.

Key Points:

The court rejected the argument that pan masala or gutka does not qualify as ""food"" under the Act.
It highlighted the paradoxical consequences of allowing local authorities to impose bans on food items, which could lead to inconsistent regulations across different areas.
The court emphasized that the power of the Food (Health) Authority is limited and temporary, not meant for broad and indefinite bans on food items.
The notifications were deemed ultra vires the Act and unconstitutional, violating the appellants' rights under Articles 14 and 19 of the Constitution.",1
87,"The case involves the prosecution of M/s. Pepsico India Holdings Pvt. Ltd. and its directors for selling Pepsi with traces of pesticide residue detected by the Public Analyst. The prosecution was initiated based on a complaint filed by the Food Inspector after purchasing the contaminated Pepsi bottles.
The Public Analyst's report confirmed the presence of Carbofuran pesticide residue in the Pepsi samples, rendering them adulterated under relevant laws.
The Chief Judicial Magistrate took cognizance of the offence and issued process against the appellants.
The appellants filed a petition in the Kerala High Court under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. seeking to quash the magistrate's order. However, the High Court dismissed the petition, prompting the appellants to appeal against this decision.

The court concluded that the appeals should be allowed based on Dahale's nomination and set aside the High Court's judgment, thereby quashing the prosecution against the appellants.",1
88,"The case involves allegations of cruelty, harassment, and demand for dowry against the appellants, who are the sister and brother of the complainant's husband. The complainant filed an FIR against them, alleging various instances of mistreatment and abuse at her matrimonial home.

The appellants filed a petition under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. to quash the chargesheet and proceedings, citing mala fide intentions and lack of territorial jurisdiction for investigation.
The High Court dismissed their petition, prompting them to appeal to the Supreme Court.
The appellants argued that the FIR lacked prima facie evidence against them and that their involvement was casually included.
The Supreme Court observed that the FIR did not disclose any material constituting an offense against the appellants and that their involvement appeared to be a casual inclusion.
Considering the lack of prima facie evidence against the appellants, the Supreme Court quashed the proceedings initiated against them.
The Supreme Court overruled the High Court's order and allowed the appeal, thereby setting aside the criminal proceedings against the appellants.",1
89,"In a case regarding the custody of minor children, the Supreme Court addressed a habeas corpus petition filed by the father. , directing that the children be returned to the USA. The court noted that while the petition was being heard, another related writ petition was pending regarding jurisdiction issues. However, the court decided not to merge the two petitions as they could be addressed separately.

The court considered the welfare of the children and observed that harm to them was not anticipated if they were returned to the jurisdiction of the court in the USA. It emphasized maintaining the child's comfort and happiness by facilitating contact with both parents, even if one parent has custody in India.

The court highlighted the directions given by the Superior Court in Arizona, USA, regarding shared parenting time and access to both parents. It concluded that even if the current petition was allowed, the arrangements made by the Superior Court would ensure the child's well-being and access to both parents during legal proceedings.

The court issued specific directions for the respondent to return the child to the jurisdiction of the Superior Court in Arizona within a specified time frame, including arrangements for travel, accommodation, and expenses.

90,"In a case concerning alleged bribery of Members of Parliament (MPs) in connection with a no-confidence motion, the issue of parliamentary privilege and immunity from prosecution under Articles 105(2) and 194(2) of the Constitution was examined. Justice SP Bharucha, then Chief Justice, held that while alleged bribe-takers who cast their votes against the motion enjoyed immunity, those who abstained from voting and the alleged bribe-givers did not.

91,"The appellant, Municipal Corporation, imposed and collected taxes from the assessee based on Capital Value assessment in the fiscal year 1998-1999, upon discovering that the assessee operated a commercial establishment within the premises. The property was later declared Enemy Property vested with the Custodian of Enemy Property for India. The assessment orders were contested by the assessee and other tenants but were ultimately dismissed. The appellant later issued a notice demanding payment from the assessee. The matter was brought before the court to determine the liability of the assessee to pay property tax and other local taxes to the Municipal Corporation.",1
92,"The appellant, the owner of an immovable property, entered into agreements with a builder for redevelopment. The complainants entered into an agreement with the builder to purchase a floor of the proposed building but were not handed over possession. They filed a complaint leading to a criminal case against the appellant, the builder, and a broker. The appellant sought anticipatory bail, which was initially granted but later withdrawn by the court. The High Court imposed a condition of depositing a certain amount as a condition for granting bail, which the appellant challenged before the Supreme Court.",1
93,"The appellant was charged with causing injury to the complainant by pelting stones, resulting in the loss of sight in one eye. After completing the investigation, the trial court framed charges against the appellant under Section 336 of the RPC. The prosecution presented evidence, including testimony from medical officers who treated the complainant.
The court found that the circumstances warranted the imposition of a deferred sentence, granting the appellant release on probation of good conduct under Section 562 of the CrPC and Section 4 of the Act of 1966. The appellant was required to enter into a bond, provide sureties, and maintain peace and good behavior for two years. Additionally, the appellant was directed to report to the Station House Officer (SHO) monthly and deposit compensation of Rs. 50,000 with the trial court for the complainant within two months.",1
94,"The incident occurred when students from a horticulture college were on an educational tour. Political unrest led to a procession by AIADMK party workers, resulting in the damaging and burning of buses carrying the students. Tragically, three students lost their lives in the fire, and others sustained injuries. Conflicting versions of the events were presented during the trial, creating doubt about the prosecution's case.

The trial court convicted 28 individuals, sentencing two to death and others to varying prison terms. On appeal, the High Court modified the convictions and reduced sentences for most defendants. However, the death sentences for three defendants were confirmed due to the deliberate and planned nature of the crime, qualifying as the ""rarest of the rare"" cases.",0
95,"The Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) entered into contracts with NEPC India Ltd. and its sister company Skyline NEPC Limited for the supply of aviation turbine fuel and aviation lubricants. Disputes arose when NEPC India Ltd. failed to make payments according to the agreed schedule, leading IOC to stop the supply of aircraft fuel. Subsequent attempts to resume supply under revised payment terms also failed.

IOC filed complaints against NEPC India Ltd. and its directors under sections 415 and 425 of the Indian Penal Code, alleging unauthorized removal of engines and parts from two hypothecated aircraft.

The defendants moved to quash the complaints, arguing that the basic ingredient of criminal breach of trust, entrustment, was missing. The High Court accepted this argument and quashed the complaints in their entirety.",0

In Crime No. 2968/2023, accused individuals, including Sandeep, allegedly offered job visas under the banner of 'SPACE International' to the complainants for a fee, promising employment opportunities in the UK. The accused purportedly obtained Rs. 14 lakhs each from multiple complainants, totaling Rs. 56 lakhs, through the account of the 3rd accused. Similar allegations were made in Crime No. 2685/2023, with one complainant, where accused individuals obtained Rs. 14 lakhs with similar promises.

The prosecution alleged that the appellant and other co-accused were involved in purchasing and distributing ganja. Charges were framed under Sections 20/25/29 of the NDPS Act and Section 120B IPC, and bail applications were subsequently filed.

The district court rejected the appellant's bail application citing the gravity of the offenses alleged, severity of punishment, and the appellant's alleged role in the crime. However, the High Court, upon review, emphasized the need for a reasonable interpretation of Section 37 of the NDPS Act, which sets conditions for granting bail in such cases. It noted that a literal interpretation would effectively deny bail altogether, leading to punitive and unsanctioned preventive detention.
The High Court clarified that the court's satisfaction regarding the accused's guilt should be prima facie, based on a broad consideration of the material on record, without requiring meticulous examination of the investigation materials. It also highlighted the applicability of Section 436A, which deals with undue delay in trials.",1
99,"Chitra Ramakrishna, the applicant/accused, was involved in a case related to alleged wrongdoing at the National Stock Exchange (NSE), including the misuse of server architecture, passing of confidential information, and illegal appointment of Anand Subramanian.

100,"The applicants were appointed to various positions within respondent No. 2. A CBI case was filed against them, alleging that they secured employment based on forged nomination letters purportedly issued by the Staff Selection Commission (SSC). Despite replying to show cause notices and providing requested information, the applicants' services were terminated without a proper inquiry. Similar orders of termination were issued to other officials, leading to legal challenges. The applicants filed Original Applications (OAs) seeking reinstatement and benefits similar to other reinstated employees. Eventually, the Tribunal ruled in favor of the applicants, quashing the termination orders and directing their reinstatement with only notional benefits.",0
101,"The case revolves around the village of Ravicherla, which was granted to the ancestors of the plaintiffs by the Government through a sanad issued in 1843. The grant contained a clause restricting the right of alienation, stating that no transfer of the village would be valid without the prior consent of the Government.

In the first year, they reported a trading loss based on the market value of their remaining stock at the end of the year. However, in the subsequent year, they attempted to revert to the purchase price of the stock as the opening value, leading to a claimed loss. The income-tax authorities contested this, arguing that the opening value should remain consistent with the previous year's market value. The dispute revolves around whether the firm can adjust their reported losses between years based on fluctuating market values.",0
103,"This case involves a suit by a Muslim co-sharer seeking recovery of her share of her father's property from her siblings. The plaintiff, a minor, had her right to sue initially denied but not contested further. The main points of contention were whether the plaintiff was entitled to mesne profits from the immovable property and whether she was entitled to interest on her share of the assets from her father's partnership. The court dismissed arguments regarding mesne profits due to lack of discussion and issue in the lower court. Regarding interest, the court found that the Interest Act did not apply as the amount in dispute was not a debt or a certain sum payable at a certain time. Instead, the court relied on principles of equity and precedent to award interest. However, the court reduced the interest rate from 8% to 6% throughout the period.",1
104,"This case involves an appeal arising from a suit to set aside an order passed against the plaintiff who attached properties in execution of a decree obtained against the 2nd defendant. The dispute centers around whether a document (Ex. I) recording the dedication of land to a temple and the appointment of a Dharmakartha (trustee) requires registration. The District Munsif initially ruled in favor of the temple, but the Subordinate Judge reversed the decision, stating that Ex. I required registration for the title to pass to the temple. However, the appellant argues that Ex. I does not require registration as it constitutes a religious trust and does not transfer property directly. The court analyzes Ex. I and concludes that it does not require registration under the Trusts Act or the Transfer of Property Act. Additionally, the court emphasizes that dedication to a deity does not necessarily require a registered instrument. Since there was no proof of fraud before the District Munsif, and the finding of bona fide gift is not disputed, the court allows the appeal, reversing the Subordinate Judge's decision and restoring that of the District Munsif with costs.",1
105,"In a suit for partition titled C.S. No. 762 of 1926 concerning the P.M.A. Firm, two applications were made. The first application, relying on Order 31, Rule 5 of the Original Side Rules, sought relief for worshippers of a temple alleging trust funds in possession of the family. However, since notice was not given to all persons having claims against the family as required by the rule, the application was dismissed.

The second application, based on Order 1, Rule 10(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure, requested leave to add the applicants as parties to the suit. The applicants asserted that the alleged trust fund was a substantial liability of the family and their presence was necessary for complete adjudication of the suit. The court agreed, noting that if the alleged trust fund existed, it would affect the determination of the family's debts and liabilities. Citing precedents and the court's discretionary power under the rule, the judge ordered the addition of the applicants as party defendants, directing that proceedings be amended accordingly and costs be awarded to the applicants.",0
106,"Plaintiff Kothandarama Ayyar sued to recover his half-share of a debt from a promissory note executed by defendants 1 and 2 in favor of his deceased brother.

107,"The case involves John McIver being tried for criminal breach of trust, with two points of law reserved for decision: whether the plea of autrefois acquit was valid, and whether there was a legal entrustment of the property as alleged by the Crown. The plea was raised after an earlier acquittal for cheating, but the High Court's order left it open. The trial Judge reserved the points under Clause 25 of the Letters Patent, despite objections.",0
108,"The case revolves around the question of whether certain properties are held in trust for a deity or if the archakas (temple priests) possess any beneficial interest in them. Under Sections 69 and 70 of the Madras Hindu Religious Endowments Act, the income of temples determines the contributions they must make, making it crucial to ascertain whether specific properties belong to the institution. The dispute arises between the archakas, who argue that the properties were given to their ancestors subject to performing certain services or were annexed to the office of archaka, and the Board, which contends that the properties were dedicated absolutely to the deity. The absence of original grant deeds complicates the matter, as does the dual liability of the archakas to supply material and perform services.",1
109,"The appeal arises from a suit filed by the predecessor-in-title of respondents 1 to 5, seeking a declaration of full ownership of certain properties and to set aside an order dismissing a claim petition. The properties belonged to a joint Hindu family, and the plaintiff claimed ownership based on a contract of sale allegedly entered into with some of the family members. The plaintiff asserted that he had paid a substantial amount as consideration and eventually obtained a sale deed executed by the Official Receiver in the context of insolvency proceedings against some of the family members. The appellants, contesting defendants, disputed the existence of the contract and the binding nature of the sale deed against certain family members. They also raised questions about the interests of other family members and their rights in the properties. The lower court ruled in favor of the plaintiff, leading to this appeal.",0
110,"This case involves two connected appeals. One appeal is from an order dismissing the appellant's application to restore a petition to set aside a sale, which had been dismissed for default. The other appeal is from the order dismissing the petition to set aside the sale itself. The appellant, who was adjudicated insolvent, made the application to set aside the sale on various grounds. The application was dismissed for default, and the subsequent application to restore it was also dismissed. The first appeal regarding the restoration of the petition is deemed incompetent based on legal precedent. The second appeal challenges the dismissal of the application to set aside the sale. The main contention is whether the appellant, being an adjudicated insolvent, has the right to apply to set aside the sale under Order 21, Rule 90 of the Civil Procedure Code. Legal precedents establish that the insolvency of the judgment-debtor does not per se render such applications incompetent. Furthermore, it is argued that the appellant was unable to attend the hearing due to illness and that the court erred in refusing an adjournment. The appellate court finds in favor of the appellant on both grounds.",1
111,"This second appeal originates from a suit regarding the enforcement of a mortgage deed executed by the first defendant in favor of Ananthu Ammal, later assigned to the fourth defendant who then assigned the rights to the plaintiff. The fifth defendant, a subsequent mortgagee, claimed priority for a sum paid towards the renewal fee of the original kanom. The trial court and the appellate court both dismissed the fifth defendant's claim. However, further findings revealed that the fifth defendant was also a mortgagee under a previous mortgage deed. The fifth defendant paid a sum towards the renewal fee of the kanom, and the question arose whether this payment entitled the fifth defendant to priority over the plaintiff's mortgage.",1
112,"P.V. Damodara Reddi and D. Duraiswami Nayudu each applied for shares in Indian National Agencies, Limited. Their applications were considered at a directors' meeting and they were allotted two shares each. However, eight months later, the directors resolved to cancel the allotment.

The company argued that the allotments were void under Article 5 of the articles of association as they lacked consent from the general meeting.",1
113,"his appeal originates from a judgment by the Subordinate Judge of Masulipatam, dismissing O.S. No. 65 of 1942, where the plaintiffs, trustees of Sri Vuddandaraya Venugopalaswami Varu temple, sued to eject defendants 1, 2, and 4 from certain properties and declare them as temple properties. The plaintiffs argued that the properties belonged to the temple, while defendants 1 and 2 claimed archaka service inams or rights acquired by usage and custom. The Subordinate Judge found that the grant of the properties was to the temple, but defendants had long possession. He concluded that the archakas couldn't be dispossessed as long as they carried out temple services. However, he also found the suit barred by limitation. The plaintiffs appealed.",1
114,"In this case, the appellant, the owner of a house in Madras, leased it to the respondent on a month-to-month basis. The respondent failed to pay rent for July 1947, leading the appellant to file an eviction application under Section 7 of Madras Act XV of 1946. The Rent Controller ordered eviction without considering the lack of notice to quit under Section 111(h) of the Transfer of Property Act. The respondent appealed to the Court of Small Causes, which upheld the eviction. Subsequently, the respondent filed a suit in the High Court challenging the order of the Rent Controller, arguing the lack of notice to quit. Two main points were raised: whether notice to quit was necessary, and whether the High Court had jurisdiction to entertain the suit.",1
115,"This case involves an appeal arising from an action filed by the respondents under the Fatal Accidents Act, 1855, against the appellant company, which operated a bus service. The accident occurred when one of the appellant's buses collided at Puliampatti, resulting in injuries to passengers and the death of Rajaratnam. The respondents, including Rajaratnam's family members, sought compensation for pecuniary loss and estate loss due to his death, alleging negligence on the part of the bus driver.

The defendants contested the claim, denying negligence and attributing the accident to the sudden failure of a bolt. The Subordinate Judge found the defendants liable for negligence and awarded compensation to the plaintiffs. The defendants appealed, raising two main points: whether the accident was due to the driver's negligence and the extent of damages payable to the plaintiffs.

The facts revealed that the accident occurred after a driver change, and the bus collided with a stone and a tree. Rajaratnam was thrown from the bus and later died in the hospital. Medical certificates and a dying declaration were presented as evidence.",0
116," The assessee, a dealer in groundnuts, operated a decorticating mill where other dealers entrusted groundnuts for processing. The assessee provided advances to these dealers and charged interest. After processing, the assessee sold the goods on behalf of the dealers and deducted the advances, interest, and processing charges before paying the balance to the dealers. The question arose whether the amount received should be included in the assessee's turnover for tax purposes. The Tribunal held that since the transaction did not involve the purchase of groundnuts by the assessee, it should not be included in the turnover. This decision was deemed correct as the transaction did not constitute taxable turnover for the assessee.",1
117,"The petitioner, a managing partner of a firm owning a factory, contested the enforcement of the Employees Provident Fund Act against them, arguing that the workers engaged in manufacturing bed-sheets and towels on hand-looms were not ""employed"" within the Act's definition. The workers were engaged on a piecework basis with no fixed hours and were considered casual laborers. The dispute centered on whether these workers qualified as employees under the Act. Despite no adjudication under Section 19-A of the Act, the court examined the nature of the relationship between the firm and the workers, applying principles of master-servant relationships and contracts for services. The court concluded that the demands should be stayed pending a decision on whether the factory qualified as per Section 1(3) of the Act.",1

He sought suspension of his sentence and release on bail citing his age (74 years) and health issues. The appellant had already served 28 months if production warrants were considered and six months otherwise. The defense argued for leniency based on the appellant's ailments, supported by medical documents. The CBI opposed leniency but did not dispute the appellant's health condition. Considering the time served, medical evidence, and precedent, the court granted bail on a bail bond of Rs. 25,000 with conditions.",1

The defense argued that the applicant was only involved in printing fake currency notes for movie shooting purposes and had no intention of circulating them. They claimed that the applicant cooperated with the investigation and that there was no evidence linking him to the circulation of counterfeit notes. However, the prosecution opposed bail, citing the seriousness of the charges, the applicant's alleged absconding status, and evidence suggesting his involvement in a large-scale conspiracy to circulate counterfeit currency.",0
122,"The appellant, father of the deceased, appeals against the bail granted to respondent No.2, accused of murdering his wife. Despite charges under Section 302 IPC, respondent No.2 obtained anticipatory bail and later regular bail, avoiding arrest.

The Assistant Commissioner upheld this decision, relying on Section 19(1) of the TNVAT Act and stating that payment by the petitioner didn't prove tax payment by the selling dealer. However, the court found this reasoning irrational and arbitrary. It noted that Section 19(1) allowed input tax credit if the dealer proved tax payment, which the petitioner did. Section 19(16) only applied to incorrect claims, not cases where taxes were genuinely paid to the selling dealer. Consequently, the court set aside the orders and allowed the writ petitions.",1
